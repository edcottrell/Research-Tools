===================

I honestly don’t know if this code still works. I haven’t updated it in years; I don’t practice law anymore and didn’t need this much over the last few years that I did, so it just collected dust. I also think Westlaw has actually implemented many if not most of the features of my script (like visually indicating concurrences and dissents) in the meantime.

That said, you’re welcome to give it a shot. This repository is actually not the most recent code. The most recent code is in the following Github gist: https://gist.github.com/edcottrell/aac1f0c470d8b47c0f4c

It's a “userscript." To use it, you need to install a browser plugin that runs userscripts, like TamperMonkey, and install it within that plugin. Again, I don't know if it will even work anymore, but I hope it does and is helpful to someone.
